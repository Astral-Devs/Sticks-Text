# Sticks-Text
#### This is a text game of the game chopsticks

## How to play
#### 1.Each person starts with 1 stick on each hand 
#### 2.One person will be randomly picked to go first (always you right now)
#### 3.You can either attack or divide in 1 turn and you can only do one of these per turn
  * When you chose to attack you pick one of your hands to attack with and you pick an enemy hand to attack   
    * You will add the number of fingers from your selected hand to the enemy hand
    * If it totals up to be greater than 5 then subtract that number by 5 to get the new value of that hand
  * To divide you **move** fingers over from one of your hands to the other
#### 4. the other person takes a turn
#### 5. repeat this until one person has no fingers left on both their hands

## Rules

#### 1. If a hand is attacked and it reaches 5 fingers it is converted to 0 fingers meaning that it is out
#### 2. When dividing you cannot fully transfer onto a dead hand
  * You can give a dead hand some fingers but you cannot transfer all of your current fingers to a dead hand
    * ex: you can divide a 4-0 into a 2-2 but you cannot turn it into a 0-4
#### 3. you cannot attack or be attacked by a dead hand
#### 4. a dead hand cant be attacked
#### 5. there may be other rules for different types of plays. this is how i personally play chopsticks
